# ERAD-SP 2018 - Hands-on

On your desktop/workstation, open a terminal or command line console and use the command ssh to login on the Skylake server and KNL Server as user traineeN (N = 01 â€¦ 20; please check with the teaching assistant which number has been assigned to you): 
 
```
ssh -X traineeN@SKYLAKE-SERVER 
ssh -X traineeN@KNL-SERVER 
```

After login on each server execute the following line to setup the environment to use Intel Parallel Studio:
```
source /opt/intel/parallel_studio_xe_2018/psxevars.sh intel64
```

# 1. Parallel Architecure 

Execute the following activities on each server (KNL and Skylake):

## 1.1. lscpu

The utility lscpu shows information about the CPU architecture. Use this utility to obtain the number of cores and threads available on each node of Heterogeneous cluster. 
 
```
lscpu 
```

**How many cores/threads are available?**

## 1.2. numactl 

The utility numactl maps processes to specific NUMA nodes. Use this utility with the parameter -H to obtain information about the NUMA nodes in the system. 
 
```
numactl -H 
```
**How many numa nodes are available**
 
## 1.3. lstopo 

The utility lstopo shows a hierarchical map of key computing elements, such as: NUMA memory nodes, shared caches, processor sockets and processor cores.

```
lstopo
```

**How many levels contains the memory systems? What is the size of each level?**

## 1.4 Option Price

Compile Option Price 
```
icpc -ltbbmalloc -xHOST -openmp -g -O3 -ipo -restrict -fimf-precision=low -fimf-domain-exclusion=31 -fno-alias -qopt-report=5  -DCOMPILER_VERSION=\""icpc-17.0.1"\" -o am_call_vp am_call.cpp
```

Run application on KNL and on Skylake
```
./am_call_vp
```

## 1.5 Transposition

Run transposition using MCDRAM on KNL

```
numactl -m 0,1,2,3 ./runme-CPU 30000 50
```

Run transposition using DRAM on KNL
```
numactl -m 4,5,6,7 ./runme-CPU 30000 50
```

Run transposition on Skylake
```
./runme-CPU 30000 50
```

What execution presents the best execution time?

# 2. Offload

Execute the following activities on Skylake:

## 2.1 Test with Offload:

Compile application using openmp

```
icc -qopenmp testHW.c -o testHW
```

Setup the list of nodes to receive offloaded code

```
export OFFLOAD_NODES=10.0.0.5
```
Run the application
```
./testHW 
Running on host: phi01.ncc.unesp.br
Running on target: phi05
```

Change the list of nodes to receive offloaded code and run the application again
```
export OFFLOAD_NODES=10.0.0.6
./testHW 
Running on host: phi01.ncc.unesp.br
Running on target: phi06
```

## 2.2 Test with Offload Data Transfer

compiling openmp

execute program

put target pragma on simple application
